I accidently set the router on a crash course, so I used the "hold" button to stop it, but I could not erase the command? It was just paused.  How do I erase the presious manual command?
Smiliarly how do I stop and erase the whole proceure in case of emergancy, apart from removing the power?
I need to set the Z axis, I have seen videos where itis a similar procedure to probing the board, but just at one point. Is there such a feature or do I do it by eye?
I hop I did this request properly? Sorry if I did not.
